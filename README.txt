This is the readme for CS 7641/4641 HW2 Randomized Search

Part 1:
    1. HwSportsArticleDataAnalysis.java
    2. sportsArticleModified.csv
    File 1 is the java file that can be used for this part. The dataset is
stored in file 2. First compile the file 1 and get a .class file and run the
.class file to get results. It can be run in cmd window.
    File 1 is modified from an ABAGAIL example. Line 79, 81 are the places for
changing te parameters for Simulated Annealing; line 98, 100, and 102 are the
places for changing the parameters for Genetic Algorithm. Line 170 is for
changing the iteration number for Randomized Hill Climbing; line 181 is for
changing the iteration number for Simulated Annealing; line 193 is for changing
the iteration number for Genetic Algorithm.

Part 2:
    1. ABAGAIL/src/opt/test/MaxColoringTest.java
    2. ABAGAIL/src/opt/test/FlipFlopTest.java
    File 1 is for k-coloring problem and file 2 is for Flip-Flop problem.
    The code for this two problems is run with IntelliJ. The places for
parameter modification is well commented and are straight forwrad in the coding.


All the data and plot are provided in the 'data.xlsx' file.
